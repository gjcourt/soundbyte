# Branching and PR Workflow Instruction

You MUST follow a branching and Pull Request workflow for all changes.
- Create a new branch for your work (e.g., `feat/feature-name`, `fix/bug-name`, `chore/task-name`).
- Bias towards the Single Responsibility Principle: each branch and PR should address one specific issue or feature.
- Avoid large, monolithic PRs. Break down complex changes into smaller, focused PRs.
- Ensure your branch is up to date with the main branch before creating a PR.
